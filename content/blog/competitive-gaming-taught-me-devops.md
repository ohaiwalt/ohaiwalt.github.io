Like many young people, I didn't have a lot of direction growing up. I joined the military after high school primarily because I didn't put enough effort into school in order to go to college. The military enforces its own discipline, but the end result of that is more a fear of consequences and a desire to do the expected thing than it is a burning drive to be *better*. It wasn't until I discovered competitve gaming, in particular StarCraft 2 and League of Legends, that I learned the skills that I attribute my professional success to these days.

I'd grown up playing video games. Started with Commodore 64 and Spy vs Spy, and moved onto NES and SNES playing Zelda and Super Mario World. I played [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GemStone_IV) with my dad in middle school, and when EverQuest released in July 1999 I was right there. 13 years old and hooked. I played feverishly, and ultimately by sheer time investment was involved in one of the more elite organizations on the world shard I played on. Four calendar years and almost a year and a half of actual played time later, I barely graduated high school and went off into the world.

# StarCraft

In 2010, while I was stationed in Italy with the Navy, [StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty) released.

# Bronze Thinking

In the lowest league of StarCraft ladder rankings, a pattern arose of people who never seemed to improve. They were characterized by rage, continually blaming others, never taking responsibility for their losses, and in general thinking that the game is hopeless. Yet for some reason, they kept playing. Initially this is where I found myself. Playing StarCraft made me clench all my muscles and stop breathing. It made me angry. I yelled, and I threw things. I had vicious tension headaches from this game that was supposed to be fun.

Thankfully somewhere in here I found the presence of mind to try to figure out what was going on. I had so many questions.

* How were these people so much better than me?
* How did they appear in my base with 2-3 times the number of units I had, and do it consistently?
* Were they hacking?



# Kaizen - Continuous Improvement

TODO: [day9 daily #100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJztfsXKcPQ)

In the small example of a game of StarCraft that lasted for 15-45 minutes, I found an iterative cycle that allowed me to test out theories. [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) is a Japanese word taken to mean 'continuous improvement' and is often associated with Toyota's production philosophies.

# Systems Thinking

By realizing that it's very rarely a single large mistake that is made that causes a loss, but the cumulative effect of many small mistakes over time, and that there is always something you could do better, led me to trying to find those small mistakes and correct the systemic failures in my gameplay.

# League of Legends

2013 -- League Madness

# Team Efforts

If we don't work as one, we work against each other. League introduced an entirely new dynamic for me, in addition to game mechanics, I had to learn to compensate and attempt to work together with four other humans and the range of emotions they bring to the table. 

# Friendship for Everyone

What's the best way to influence people to achieve positive outcomes? Hint: It's not by yelling at them. 

I had previously been exposed primarily to negative reinforcement, and a 'suck it up and deal' mentality was expected norm. It was only after spending months playing League of Legends that I realized the vast majority of the world doesn't respond well to 'unfuck yourself'. In fact, most people seem to respond wholly negatively to that statement! Go figure.

After spending a long time being frustrated right back to a bronze mindset -- which, it turns out, exists in League too! -- I found Greg Williams' [Climbing the ELO ladder using DST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz7TWpRXyRY) video.

TODO: talk about positive, amplifying things rather than calling out mistakes, focus on how to improve a situation
