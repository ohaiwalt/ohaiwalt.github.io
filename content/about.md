# About Me

I'm Matthew Walter, a site reliability engineer working in NYC. I'm working on building a platform to make government beautiful with [SeamlessDocs](http://www.seamlessdocs.com).

# History

After high school, I joined the [United States Navy](https://www.navy.com/) as a [Cryptologic Technician Maintenance](https://www.navy.com/careers/information-and-technology/cryptology.html) and after a few months in Great Lakes, Illinois and Pensacola, Florida spent three years building communications centers out of Hawaii from 2005-2008.

As my time wound to a close in Hawaii I changed job fields to [Information Systems Technician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems_technician_(United_States_Navy)), and after another few months of training chose orders to the [USS Mount Whitney LCC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Mount_Whitney_(LCC-20)) in Gaeta, Italy from 2008-2011. During my time on the Mount Whitney, I was exposed to many manual processes for managing high(er) security environments. After picking up Linux for the first time in 2009, I started to find that there was a better way, and began to focus on learning about automation and software development.

After leaving Italy to move to Baltimore, Maryland, I worked as a network engineer doing break/fix on point-to-point SONET lines from 2011-2012. While this was a different learning experience, it left me with 12 hour midnight shifts and nothing to do unless something was broken, so I spent all my available time reading [Safari Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/) and learning how large scale systems were built and run.

I left active duty in September 2012 and moved to Fairfield, Connecticut to attend Fairfield University in pursuit of a B.S in Software Engineering, as I identified that many of my career goals required programming skills. After winter 2013, I left Fairfield University in order to pursue a professional career after an economics professor and I had a long talk about opportunity cost. I continued to maintain an attachment to the Navy Reserve until March of 2016.
