      <description>2017 was a doozy. Thinking back though, it was a really great year for me.
 Someone important that I had lost touch with wandered back into my life just after midnight on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, setting a great tone for the year.
 My daughter is happy, healthy, and more independent than ever at age five. Watching her learn and grow has been a constant joy this year.</description>

      <description>A friend introduced me to Devember yesterday, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to hop on. Devember is a personal goal of spending an hour a day coding for the month of December, with public accountability.
I&amp;rsquo;ll have a public record on GitHub with some code samples as I create them as well as a daily log of my efforts.
The proclamation:
I, Matthew Walter, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be working with Python and Go.</description>

      <description>There was a time in my life where I had trouble committing to things. This time was characterized by dissatisfaction and unhappiness. It didn&amp;rsquo;t really manifest as unhappiness at the time, more it was a low level restlessness that resulted in never sticking with anything, or investing my real and honest self into anything be it relationships, professional development, or hobbies.
After leaving active duty in 2012 and separating from the Navy, I found I missed the water and craved seeing the sunset without land in sight.</description>
